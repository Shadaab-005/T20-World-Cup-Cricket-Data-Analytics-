# Cricket Data Analytics Project Using Web Scraping, Python, Pandas, and Power BI  

## Overview  
The T20 Cricket World Cup 2022 finished with England claiming victory over Pakistan. This project starts a cricket data analytics series using the same T20 World Cup data. I scraped data from the ESPNcricinfo website, performed data cleaning and transformation in Pandas, and built dashboards in Power BI.  

## Problem Statement  
Planet Sporta challenged planet Earth to play cricket. If we defeated them, we kept Earth; if we lost, we joined them as interns. The task was to identify the best 11 players based on the T20 World Cup Cricket data.  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Web Scraping**: I collected match results, player statistics, and detailed scorecards using Bright Data.  
2. **Data Cleaning**: I transformed the scraped JSON data into a structured format using Pandas.  
3. **Data Analysis**: I analyzed player performance metrics such as batting average, strike rate, and bowling economy.  
4. **Dashboard Creation**: I built interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize the data and derive insights.  

## Team Selection Algorithm  
- **Openers**: Power hitters who scored runs quickly.  
- **Middle Order**: Anchors who stabilized the innings if needed.  
- **Finishers**: Players who accelerated the scoring in the final overs.  
- **All-rounders**: Players who contributed with both bat and ball.  
- **Bowlers**: Fast bowlers and spinners who took wickets and restricted runs.  

### Key Metrics for Selection  
- Batting average  
- Strike rate  
- Boundary percentage  
- Bowling economy  
- Wicket-taking ability  

## Data Sources  
The primary data source for this project was the T20 World Cup match data from [ESPNcricinfo](https://www.espncricinfo.com/).  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Web Scraping**: Bright Data (Data Collector)  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas  
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI  
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub  

## Final Team Selection  
- **Openers**: Jos Buttler, Rilee Russouw  
- **Middle Order**: Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Glenn Phillips  
- **All-rounders**: Marcus Stoinis, Shadab Khan  
- **Bowlers**: Sam Curran, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Anrich Nortje  
  

## Conclusion  
With the selected team, I aimed to save Earth by defeating the aliens in cricket. The final 11 players were chosen based on their performance metrics, ensuring a strong and competitive team.
